## 1. Introduction

DateSense respects your privacy.  
This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when you use the DateSense application.

DateSense is designed to work entirely on your device.  
We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share your personal data with third parties.

---

## 2. Data We Process

DateSense processes only the information that you choose to enter, which may include:

- self-reflections;
- subjective ratings of interactions;
- personal notes or answers to in-app questions.

This data exists solely to generate insights for you.

In order to provide account-based functionality, DateSense also processes an email address used for account creation and authentication. This may be a user-provided email address or a private relay address provided by Apple Sign In.

The email address is used solely for account management purposes, is not used for marketing or tracking, and is not shared with third parties.

## 3. Local-Only Storage

All data is stored locally on your device.

- No data is sent to external servers.
- No cloud storage is used.
- No third-party analytics or tracking tools are integrated.

If you delete the app or use the in-app delete option, all stored data is permanently removed.

---

## 4. Data Control

You are fully in control of your data.

- You can delete your data at any time from within the app.
- You can protect access using Face ID, Touch ID, or a PIN code (if enabled).
- DateSense does not retain backups of your data.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

DateSense does not share your data with third parties.

System-level services provided by Apple (such as Face ID or Touch ID) are handled entirely by the operating system.  
DateSense never accesses biometric data directly.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

DateSense is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.

If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you should use the app with the understanding that it is designed for self-reflection and personal insight, not as a substitute for professional support.

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  
Any changes will be published at this location.

Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
